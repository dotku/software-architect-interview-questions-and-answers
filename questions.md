## Questions
### Operational and Situational questions

#### Can you explain how would you implement a newer version of a live website?

1. I will try to get the requirement
2. I will break the requirement to doable tasks and confirm with the requirement submitters.
Sometimes, the requirement submiter might not be the technicial person, but at least let the person know as much as it should.

#### How will you assist your new teammate?

I will ask them to get involve as much as they came, and help them resolve any kind of problems they might facing in advice or 
encurage them to face the problem or provide some trade off solutions.

#### How will you identify the person who is responsible for each task in a software project?

Sprint meeting would be helpful to identify the task for a certain person. We could use JIRA to trace the task and progress.

#### How will you make a payment processing system? What steps would you take to modify if it was a distributed system?

As a distributed system, microservice archtecture would be a solution to adress it.

### Role-specific questions

#### Define scalability.

A scalable solution should be able to handle large amount of data or process in a proper time, eg 
we should able to return the result of process under few second.

#### What is the difference between an object-oriented and component-based design?

They are actually pretty similar but, OOP would be more focusing on description of a item instead of usebility which 
component-based addressed. Eg, we could have a person as Object, but we use Permission component to manage the person's 
authority.

#### Describe clustering and its purpose.

Clustering is the way we blance the computing or storage, eg. loading balance.

#### What are the requirements for enabling a Java EE application session replication?

// @todo, I have no idea...

#### Explain the process of gathering system requirements.

Basically hardware and software requirement. The hardware would be computing power, memory, storage and etc, and the 
software requimrent would be operation system, dependencies software or programs, configuration and etc.

#### Mention the database management systems you have worked with.

Eg. MySQL, MSSQL, Oracel SQL, DB2, Carssandra, MongoDB, Postgres, Hive and ect.

#### Name the tools that you use to test code.

Jest, Cypress and JUnit.

### Behavioral Questions

#### Describe the time when you designed innovative software.

I think several projects are pretty innovative. Here I would mention two of them, one for IoT and the other one would be SaaS.
For IoT project, I created a IoT logic editor, so I got involued with designer and IoT researcher to get the design and 
requirement of the tool. I break it down to components and implment the features, including UX, API interaction and 
software architecture design.
For SaaS project is similar, usually there is already have a certain UI Design, we go over together to understand the 
requirement, and breakdown to tasks.

#### How would you explain technical details to a non-technical audience? Also, tell us how would you ensure that 
everybody understands your presentation?

I will use the terminologies they can understand. I will demostartion usage of the product if possible. 
I will double check with them to make sure if they understand my persentation.

#### Describe a complex software development project that you have managed?

I got involed with a project that facing to multiple clients with different requirments. Different client ask for different
requirement for the sample product. We might need update the product onsite in client's office. There is a lot of travel, 
documentation, and training.

By that time, we don't have any project mangement tool, eg JIRA. Email, chat and phone call would be the 
criticle communication tool we can depend on. Also we use Execle sheet to help us to understand the piority of tasks.
depende on.
